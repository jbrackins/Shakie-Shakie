# Shakie-Shakie
Shakie Shakie!

This is either going to be the worst thing ever or the absolute worst thing ever. Part fitness app, part pet simulator. The app tasks you with raising a Shakie-Shakie, a rare creature that must be shaken to assist with the metabolization of food. Uses the phone accelerometer. A lot.
